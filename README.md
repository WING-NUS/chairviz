# ChairViz - Analysis and Visualization engine for academic conference chairs

Anyone chairing a conference/workshop? We have something for you.

Chairviz uses conference metadata output from EasyChair to create charts and plots about
acceptance ratios, submission times, author acceptances, keyword
clouds, and track statistics.
